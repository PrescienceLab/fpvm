- how to handle comparisons that do not fault
   possibly add a whole system patcher a la vmware

COMISD - faults on SNan or Qnan
UCOMISD - faults on SNan

These shouold be fine, but there may be others


- Need to verify correct behavior for conversion operations 

Note that f2i is only overwriting the part of the register target
that is get the output.   This probably should handle zeroing the
rest of the register in case this is the excepted behavior (not sure)


- Clearly document the compilation/etc technique that Alex found
  for forcing only SSE2 or other limits

FPVM Tool 
=========

Copyright (c) 2021 Peter A. Dinda  Please see LICENSE file.

This is a tool for floating point trap and emulate processing
on x64.

This is a work in progress


Configuring, Building and Testing
--------------------

To Configure:

   $ make menuconfig


To build:

   $ make


To test:

   $ make test


Running
-------

To run against a binary:

   $ LD_PRELOAD=build/fpvm.so exec.exe


Testing with pre-patched benchmarks
-----------------------------------

There are 5 binaries that we have processed for the purposes of testing fpvm.
- fbench
- lorenz_attractor
- three_body_simulation
- enzo
- nas/cg

To run one of these on FPVM, use the "test.sh" file:
   
   $ ./test.sh fbench
   $ ./test.sh lorenz
   $ ./test.sh three-body
   $ ./test.sh enzo
   $ ./test.sh nas

There will be information printed to stdout, but all output files will go to:
./test_output/<test-name>


Forcing SSE
-----------

To compile SSE only:

gcc ..... -mno-avx -mno-avx2 -mno-avx512f -mno-avx512pf -mno-avx512er -mno-avx512cd

To force libc to use SSE only:

export GLIBC_TUNABLES=glibc.cpu.hwcaps=-AVX2_Usable,-AVX_Usable,-AVX512_Usable



Adding a new alternative math implementation
--------------------------------------------

If you want to add your own alternative math implementation, foo, edit
Kconfig to add your alternative math to the choice option, calling it
`ALT_MATH_FOO` in this example.  Then add your implementation to
`src/alt/foo.cpp`. Wrap all your code except for `#include
<fpvm/config.h>` in `#if CONFIG_ALT_MATH_FOO`, so the compiler doesn't
compile your implementation unless you want it to.
